"My interest outside of coding include visiting
museums,cooking,mixed martial arts, 
making music, and thinking about how i
can better improve myself. i dont drink
or indulge in any drugs I try to keep
a cool head at all times. I am always 
open to suggestions on what I
could do better because my goal in 
life is to grow as a person."
